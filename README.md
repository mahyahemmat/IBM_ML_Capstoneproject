# IBM_ML_Capstoneproject

In this project, I used a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data to find the best classifier algorithm that can accept/reject a loan application based on the probability that the loan is going to be paid off or not. The algorithms tried are:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
